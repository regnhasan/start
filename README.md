Hello welcome to my log journal.

This is the start of my coding and hacking journey.

whoami?
I am a young, enthusiastic boy who has been lost in life. I have been playing with crypto for almost 5 years now (2025 rn). I have tasted success and defeat. But that led me nowhere, I was stuck in a cycle: gamble big → win → lose → chase again. This felt like building a future, but it’s not. It’s a dopamine trap disguised as hustle.
I had a low self-esteem. I thought to myself that I am nothing and useless if I didn't catch the next 100x on a crypto coin.
I didn't gain anything valuable. _what remains valuable?_ **Transferable skills. Real output. Discipline. Execution.**
It's time I wake up and actually become someone _valuable_. 

My goal is to become a sophisticated, pro hacker. And become a valuable human being. 


i will follow this roadmap:
