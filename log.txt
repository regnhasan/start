Day 3. did level 19-20 for bandit, learned how to use nc, and that you can use it as a communication between ports as well. going to some 'Psychology of Money' by Morgan Housel now. Gn
Day 4. I finished the Networking Fundamentals on THM, paid that 100 eur for a yearly sub. I also did, for educational purposes, learn how to get API's on a website like x.com which can be used for many other stuff. I just did it for experimental and educational purposes, to improve myself. My notebook came from Temu, so i'll use it to journal myself and reflect weekly.
Day 5. Little progress, only did one room in THM, revised about the OSI model. The 7 layers. Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application (yay i got that right first time ^^
Day 6. Finished the Networking Fundamentals course on THM. 83% Path progress on Pre Security. Tomorrow I shall finish the Windows Fundamentals course and finish Pre Security. After that I will start picking up 'Automate the boring stuff' to start my python learning. I also plan to learn Golang as it's a better language in terms of tools creating and crypto tools
Day 7. Today was a lazy day. I had plans to make it a productive day but ended up taking a 5 hour nap... don't know if u can call it a nap. Finished Windows fundamentals 1 & 2, it was super boring and i don't want to do the 3rd one now, today is a lazy day so i will take rest now. Next time I shall finish the 3rd one, and start my python jouŕney
Day 8. Finished Pre Security.
Day 9. Today I didn't do much. But I learned how to create a Vanity Address on Solana. Created one for fun, want some uniqueness as most wallets created are just random skribble. I shall use that wallet in the future! I also learned how to make things easier (but with the help of ChatGPT). It's very convenient to learn how to automate stuff, which is why I shall start my Automate the Boring Stuff journey tomorrow!
Day 10. I finished the Search Skills room in THM, tried to learn Active Directory Basics but it's too much information and my brain got fried today. I will take a break now. I still haven't started on coding which I must do this month...
Day 11. Learned the Windows Command Line and the Windows Powershell, seems like very powerful and nice tools created by Microsoft, but I still prefer Linux and its easy cmdlets. Powershell is strong but hard
